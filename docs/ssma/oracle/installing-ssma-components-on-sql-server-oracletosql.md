# Install SSMA components on SQL Server (OracleToSQL)

In addition to installing SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA), you must also install components on the computer that runs [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. These components include the SSMA extension pack, which supports data migration, and Oracle providers to enable server-to-server connectivity.

## SSMA for Oracle extension pack

The SSMA extension pack deploys extended stored procedures, and adds the `sysdb` database to the specified instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Extended stored procedures provide functionality required to emulate features and behavior of Oracle, while the `sysdb` database contains the tables and stored procedures required to migrate the data.

> [!NOTE]  
> Extended stored procedures are deprecated in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and will be removed in a future version. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Create [Common language runtime (CLR) procedures](../../relational-databases/clr-integration/common-language-runtime-integration-overview.md) instead.

Also, when you migrate data to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], SSMA creates [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent jobs when the server-side data migration engine is used for migrating the data.

## Prerequisites

Before you install the SSMA for Oracle server components on [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], make sure that the system meets the following requirements:

- Windows 11 and later versions, or Windows Server 2022 and later versions.

- The [!INCLUDE [dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 4.7.2 or a later version. [Download .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).

- A [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance is installed.

- The OLE DB provider for Oracle (if using OLE DB), and connectivity to the Oracle database that you want to migrate. You can install providers from the Oracle product media or Oracle Web site.

  > [!IMPORTANT]  
  > The SSMA extension pack extended stored procedures aren't compatible with [UTF-8 server collations](../../relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support.md#utf8) (for example, `Latin1_General_100_CI_AI_SC_UTF8`). The SSMA-generated functions declare output parameters as **varchar(max)**, which the internal ODBC driver maps to legacy LOB types. On servers that use a UTF-8 collation, the `master` database also uses UTF-8, which causes the loopback call from the extended stored procedures to fail. With ODBC Driver 17, this failure produces silently incorrect results. With ODBC Driver 18, you receive the error: `Cannot convert to text/ntext or collate to 'Latin1_General_100_CI_AI_SC_UTF8'`. If your server uses a UTF-8 collation, don't rely on the SSMA extension pack extended stored procedures.

- The [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service must be running during installation. The service populates a list of the instances of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in the Setup wizard. You can disable the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service after installation.

  If the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Browser service is running, but you still don't see a list of instances in Setup, you must unblock UDP port 1434. You can use Windows Firewall to temporarily unblock the port, or you can temporarily disable Windows Firewall. You might also have to temporarily disable antivirus software. Make sure to enable firewalls and antivirus software after installation.

## Install the extension pack

You can install the extension pack at any time before you migrate data to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To install the extension pack, you must be a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role on the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

To install the extension pack:

1. Copy `SSMAforOracleExtensionPack_<n>.msi` (where `<n>` is the build number) to the computer running [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
1. Double-click the MSI to run it.
1. On the **Welcome** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **End-User License Agreement** page, read the license agreement. If you agree, select **I accept the agreement**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Choose Setup Type** page, select **Typical**.
1. On the **Ready to Install** page, select **Install**.
1. On the **Completed the First Step of Installation** page, select **Next**.

   A new dialog box appears. Select the extension pack type.

1. Select the desired installation type, and then select **Next**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > Use the remote option only when installing the extension pack on [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on Linux or when targeting [!INCLUDE [ssAzureMi](../../includes/ssazuremi-md.md)]. Always install the extension pack locally for [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installations running on Windows. [!INCLUDE [ssazure-sqldb](../../includes/ssazure-sqldb.md)] and Azure Synapse Analytics don't support the extension pack.

   If you install the extension pack on a local [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance, you can choose a local instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to which you migrate Oracle schemas. Choose an instance in the dropdown list, and then select **Next**.

   The default instance has the same name as the computer. Named instances are followed by a backslash and the instance name.

1. On the connection page, select the authentication method and then select **Next**.

   Windows Authentication uses your Windows credentials to try to sign in to the instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. If you select Server Authentication, you must enter a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login name and password.

1. The next step requires you to set the password for a master key that encrypts any sensitive data stored in the extension pack database during server-side data migration. Provide a strong password and select **Next**.

1. On the next page, select **Install Utilities Database *n* and Install Extension Pack libraries**, where *n* is the version number, and then select **Next**.

   The `sysdb` database is created with the tables, and stored procedures required for data migration are created in this database (using the server-side data migration engine).

1. When installation is complete, a prompt appears asking if you want to install Utilities Database on another instance of [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Select **Yes**, and then select **Next**. To exit the wizard, select **No** and then select **Exit**.

1. In [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or by using the **`sqlcmd`** utility, run the following script to enable CLR:

   ```sql
   EXECUTE sp_configure 'clr enabled', 1;
   GO

   RECONFIGURE;
   GO
   ```

   If CLR isn't enabled, you receive the following error when SSMA connects to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:

   ```output
   SSMA could not retrieve the extension pack assembly version information. Reinstall the extension pack on the database server.
   ```

## SQL Server database objects

After you install the extension pack, the `ssma_oracle.bcp_migration_packages` table appears in the `sysdb` database.

Every time you migrate data to [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], SSMA creates a [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent job. These jobs are named `ssma_oracle data migration package {GUID}`, and you can see them in the [!INCLUDE [ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent node of [!INCLUDE [ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] in the Jobs folder.

The following extended stored procedures are added to the `master` database:

- `xp_ora2ms_exec2`
- `xp_ora2ms_exec2_ex`
- `xp_ora2ms_versioninfo2`
